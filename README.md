# WSU_TAassign

## **What is this?**

This project is a web application that will be used to assign Teaching Assistants (TAs) to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) courses at Washington State University (WSU). The School of EECS at WSU recruits TAs every semester for introductory courses. Currently, this process is done manually, which can be tedious for both students and instructors looking for TA positions. Our web application will, therefore, automate and centralize this process. Students applying to be TAs will register through the application, where they will enter their contact information, course teaching preferences and any additional related information. EECS Faculty will also register through the application in order to search and assign TA positions to the courses/labs that they oversee.

## **Goals of the project**
The application will further be split into a Student Side and an Instructor Side:

- For the Student Side, students who are willing to serve as TAs will fill out information where they specify their personal information, academic background and course preferences  
- For the Instructor Side, instructors who are in charge of assigning TAs to their course look at the available student TAs and decide which students fit their course criteria. The instructors then manually match the student chosen for the TA position to their respective courses and/or labs.
